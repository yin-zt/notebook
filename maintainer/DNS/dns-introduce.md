**what is DNS?
DNS is a application protocol in the seventh level of the TCP protocol.

**what can we use dns to do?
we usually use dns to resolve one domain to some IP or other domains which can help us in many ways. For example,
when a programmer creates a program and install it on the specify machine, the users will call its api with the ip of
machine. But with the growth of business, the program needs to install on more than one machine. If we still use the old
way to access, we need to know all the ip of machine. It is difficult for us to do that. Therefore, we need a middle
plugin which can help us access program service and we just need to access fix domain. It is the reason why dns protocol
would be created.
